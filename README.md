### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!
---
👋 I'm Daniel.
Currently, I'm serving in the Israeli Air Force and I'll be completing my military service in August 2024.

🚀 Throughout my military service, I've harnessed my programming skills to automate tasks and enhance efficiency. It's incredible to see how technology can make our work smarter and more efficient.

🐍 Python is not just a programming language for me; it's my creative canvas. My next destination is the exciting world of ML, where I'm determined to apply my skills to create innovative, AI-driven software that pushes boundaries and shapes the future.
My goal? To transition into a career as a Machine Learning (ML) Software Engineer and contribute to the ever-evolving field of AI.

🗓️ I'll be completing my military service in August 2024, and I'm actively preparing for the next phase of my journey in the ML software industry.
